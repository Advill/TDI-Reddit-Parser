# TDI-Reddit-Parser
A Node.js project to parse through reddit based on a search for important 
information.

## Goal
The goal of this project is an excersize in api design as well as an intro to
node.js.

## Current State
At this point, jsontest only imports the json and prints it to the command
line. I'm still figuring out how I want to get the data ready for viewing, have
not decided what is important or anything like that yet.

I'm not serving data to localhost or anything yet.
