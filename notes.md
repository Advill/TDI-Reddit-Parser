# Notes
this is going to serve as a general notes file for things I figure out about
node.js and JSON files as I go through this project.

## JSON
###structure
I need to pay a lot of attention to the structure of any data I am taking in.
I have spent the past 2 days trying to figure out how to import data from
reddit's posts, missing data.children.*data*.whatever. So from now on I need
to be paying closer attention to what I'm working with.
